Public interventions are created not to impose and be temporary, but as forms intended to activate discourse and discussion. Considering the concept of a museum as a public device and how they are searching for new ways of avoiding generic identities, we will deal with the concept of the personal imaginary museum. It should be considered as a point of departure to propose a personal individual construction based on the concept of defining a personal imaginary museum - concept, program, collection, events, architecture, public diffusion, etc.",https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/4-367-studio-seminar-in-public-art-spring-2006/,"['Fine Arts', 'Architecture', 'Architectural Design', 'Art History', 'Visual Arts']",0,23

Classical Mechanics,"<p>This first course in the physics curriculum introduces classical mechanics. Historically, a set of core concepts—space, time, mass, force, momentum, torque, and angular momentum—were introduced in classical mechanics in order to solve the most famous physics problem, the motion of the planets.</p>
<p>The principles of mechanics successfully described many other phenomena encountered in the world. Conservation laws involving energy, momentum and angular momentum provided a second parallel approach to solving many of the same problems. In this course, we will investigate both approaches: Force and conservation laws.</p>
<p>Our goal is to develop a conceptual understanding of the core concepts, a familiarity with the experimental verification of our theoretical laws, and an ability to apply the theoretical framework to describe and predict the motions of bodies.</p>

Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism,"<p>Electricity and magnetism dominate much of the world around us – from the most fundamental processes in nature to cutting-edge electronic devices. Electric and magnetic fields arise from charged particles. Charged particles also feel forces in electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell’s equations, in addition to describing this behavior, also describe electromagnetic radiation.&nbsp;</p>

Physics III: Vibrations and Waves,"<p>Vibrations and waves are everywhere. If you take any system and disturb it from a stable equilibrium, the resultant motion will be waves and vibrations. Think of a guitar string—pluck the string, and it vibrates. The sound waves generated make their way to our ears, and we hear the string’s sound. Our eyes see what’s happening because they receive the electromagnetic waves of the light reflected from the guitar string, so that we can recognize the beautiful sinusoidal waves on the string. In fact, without vibrations and waves, we could not recognize the universe around us at all!</p>

<p>The amazing thing is that we can describe many fascinating phenomena arising from very different physical systems with mathematics. This course will provide you with the concepts and mathematical tools necessary to understand and explain a broad range of vibrations and waves. You will learn that waves come from many interconnected (coupled) objects when they are vibrating together. We will discuss many of these phenomena, along with related topics, including mechanical vibrations and waves, sound waves, electromagnetic waves, optics, and gravitational waves.</p>

Quantum Physics I,"<p>This is the first course in the undergraduate Quantum Physics sequence. It introduces the basic features of quantum mechanics. It covers the experimental basis of quantum physics, introduces wave mechanics, Schrödinger’s equation in a single dimension, and Schrödinger’s equation in three dimensions.

<p>This presentation of 8.04 by Barton Zwiebach (2016) differs somewhat and complements nicely the presentation of <a href=""/courses/8-04-quantum-physics-i-spring-2013/"">Allan Adams (2013)</a>. Adams covers a larger set of ideas; Zwiebach tends to go deeper into a smaller set of ideas, offering a systematic and detailed treatment. Adams begins with the subtleties of superpostion, while Zwiebach discusses the surprises of interaction-free measurements. While both courses overlap over a sizable amount of standard material, Adams discussed applications to condensed matter physics, while Zwiebach focused on scattering and resonances. The different perspectives of the instructors make the problem sets in the two courses rather different.</p>

The goal of this seminar is to explore the role of science and scientists in ecosystems and natural resources management focusing on joint fact finding as a new approach to environmental policy-making.&nbsp;Increasingly scientists and science organizations are confronting a conundrum: Why is science often ignored in important societal decisions even as the call for decisions based on sound science escalates? One reason is that decision-making is often driven by a variety of nonscientific, adversarial, and stakeholder dynamics. Thus, even though science helps inform choices, it is only one of many values and interests considered by each stakeholder. In response to this emerging challenge, scientists, and science agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey, are embarking upon research that explores the problems of incorporating science into value-laden societal decisions. This research includes designing experiments that will assess the appropriateness of using the new and emerging approach of Joint Fact Finding to address some of the Nation’s most contentious environmental conflicts.

City Visions: Past and Future,"This class is intended to introduce students to understandings of the city generated from both social science literature and the field of urban design. The first part of the course examines literature on the history and theory of the city. Among other factors, it pays special attention to the larger territorial settings in which cities emerged and developed (ranging from the global to the national to the regional&nbsp;context) and how these affected the nature, character, and functioning of cities and the lives of their inhabitants. The remaining weeks focus more explicitly on the theory and practice of design visions for the city, the latter in both utopian and realized form. One of our aims will be to assess the conditions under which a variety of design visions were conceived, and to assess them in terms of the varying patterns of territorial “nestedness” (local, regional, national, imperial, and global) examined in the first part of the course. Another will be to encourage students to think about the future prospects of cities (in terms of territorial context or other political functions and social aims) and to offer design visions that might reflect these new dynamics.",https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/11-949-city-visions-past-and-future-spring-2004/,"['Fine Arts', 'Architecture', 'Environmental Design', 'Humanities', 'History', 'Comparative History', 'Social Science', 'Sociology', 'Urban Studies']",4,111

Reflective Practice: An Approach for Expanding Your Learning Frontiers,"<p>The course is an introduction to the approach of Reflective Practice developed by Donald Schön. It is an approach that enables professionals to understand how they use their knowledge in practical situations and how they can combine practice and learning in a more effective way. Through greater awareness of how they deploy their knowledge in practical situations, professionals can increase their capacities of learning in a more timely way. Understanding how they frame situations and ideas helps professionals to achieve greater flexibility and increase their capacity of conceptual innovation.</p>
<p>The objective of the course is to introduce students to the approach and methods of reflective practice by raising their awareness about their own cognitive resources and how they use them in their practice. The course will introduce theories of learning, knowledge generation, framing and reframing, theories of action, reflection-in-practice, and conceptual innovation, and provide students with opportunities to experiment with these theories in real life through practical exercises in which they reflect on real situations that they have faced in their past professional experience. Through these practical exercises, students will have the opportunity to reflect on their thinking capacities in the context of their practice.</p>

The Challenge of World Poverty,"<p>This is a course for those who are interested in the challenge posed by massive and persistent world poverty, and are hopeful that economists might have something useful to say about this challenge. The questions we will take up include: Is extreme poverty a thing of the past? What is economic life like when living under a dollar per day? Why do some countries grow fast and others fall further behind? Does growth help the poor? Are famines unavoidable? How can we end child labor—or should we? How do we make schools work for poor citizens? How do we deal with the disease burden? Is micro finance invaluable or overrated? Without property rights, is life destined to be “nasty, brutish and short”? Has globalization been good to the poor? Should we leave economic development to the market? Should we leave economic development to non-governmental organizations (NGOs)? Does foreign aid help or hinder? Where is the best place to intervene?</p>

A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra,"<p>These brief videos, recorded in 2020, contain ideas and suggestions from Professor Strang about the recommended order of topics in teaching and learning linear algebra. The first topic is called <em>A New Way to Start Linear Algebra</em>. The key point is to start right in with the columns of a matrix <em>A</em> and the multiplication <em>Ax</em> that combines those columns.</p>
<p>That leads to <em>The Column Space of a Matrix</em> and the idea of independent columns and the factorization <em>A = CR</em> that tells so much about <em>A</em>. With good numbers, every student can see dependent columns.</p>
<p>The remaining videos outline very briefly the full course: <em>The Big Picture of Linear Algebra</em>; <em>Orthogonal Vectors</em>; <em>Eigenvalues &amp; Eigenvectors</em>; and <em>Singular Values &amp; Singular Vectors</em>. Singular values have become so important and they come directly from the eigenvalues of <em>A’A</em>.</p>
<p>A new video recorded in 2021, <em>Finding the Nullspace: Solving Ax = 0 by Elimination</em>, computes the nullspace of any matrix <em>A</em>.</p>
<p>You can see this new idea developing in the <a href=""/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/resources/lecture-1-the-column-space-of-a-contains-all-vectors-ax"">first video lecture</a> of Professor Strang’s 2019 course <em><a href=""/courses/18-065-matrix-methods-in-data-analysis-signal-processing-and-machine-learning-spring-2018/"">18.065 Matrix Methods in Data Analysis, Signal Processing, and Machine Learning</a></em>.</p>

Electromagnetic Fields and Energy,"<p>Published in 1989 by Prentice-Hall, this book is a useful resource for educators and self-learners alike. The text is aimed at those who have seen Maxwell’s equations in integral and differential form and who have been exposed to some integral theorems and differential operators. A hypertext version of this textbook can be found <a href=""http://web.mit.edu/6.013_book/www/book.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">here</a>. An accompanying set of video demonstrations is available below.</p>
<p>These video demonstrations convey electromagnetism concepts. The demonstrations are related to topics covered in the textbook. They were prepared by Markus Zahn, James R. Melcher, and Manuel L. Silva and were produced by the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>The purpose of these demonstrations is to make mathematical analysis of electromagnetism take on physical meaning. Based on relatively simple configurations and arrangements of equipment, they make a direct connection between what has been analytically derived and what is observed. They permit the student to observe physically what has been described symbolically. Often presented with a plot of theoretical predictions that are compared to measured data, these demonstrations give the opportunity to test the range of validity of the theory and present a quantitative approach to dealing with the physical world.</p>
<p>The short form of these videos contains the demonstrations only. The long form also presents theory, diagrams, and calculations in support of the demonstrations.</p>
<p>These videos are used in the courses <a href=""/courses/6-013-electromagnetics-and-applications-spring-2009/"">6.013/ESD.013J</a> and <a href=""/courses/6-641-electromagnetic-fields-forces-and-motion-spring-2009/"">6.641</a>.</p>

Signals and Systems,"<p>This course was developed in 1987 by the MIT Center for Advanced Engineering Studies. It was designed as a distance-education course for engineers and scientists in the workplace.</p>
<p>Signals and Systems is an introduction to analog and digital signal processing, a topic that forms an integral part of engineering systems in many diverse areas, including seismic data processing, communications, speech processing, image processing, defense electronics, consumer electronics, and consumer products.</p>
<p>The course presents and integrates the basic concepts for both continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems. Signal and system representations are developed for both time and frequency domains. These representations are related through the Fourier transform and its generalizations, which are explored in detail. Filtering and filter design, modulation, and sampling for both analog and digital systems, as well as exposition and demonstration of the basic concepts of feedback systems for both analog and digital systems, are discussed and illustrated.</p>

Digital Signal Processing,"<p>This course was developed in 1987 by the MIT Center for Advanced Engineering Studies. It was designed as a distance-education course for engineers and scientists in the workplace.</p>
<p>Advances in integrated circuit technology have had a major impact on the technical areas to which digital signal processing techniques and hardware are being applied. A thorough understanding of digital signal processing fundamentals and techniques is essential for anyone whose work is concerned with signal processing applications.</p>
<p>Digital Signal Processing begins with a discussion of the analysis and representation of discrete-time signal systems, including discrete-time convolution, difference equations, the z-transform, and the discrete-time Fourier transform. Emphasis is placed on the similarities and distinctions between discrete-time. The course proceeds to cover digital network and nonrecursive (finite impulse response) digital filters. Digital Signal Processing concludes with digital filter design and a discussion of the fast Fourier transform algorithm for computation of the discrete Fourier transform.</p>
